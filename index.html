      <span class="question">How do I set up a basic React Native project?</span>
      <div class="answer">Use the React Native CLI or Expo CLI to initialize a new project. The CLI tools help create a starter project structure and dependencies.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">What are the key differences between React and React Native?</span>
      <div class="answer">React is for web development, while React Native is used for mobile apps. React Native uses native components rather than HTML elements.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How can I use hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> in React Native?</span>
      <div class="answer"><code>useState</code> manages component state, and <code>useEffect</code> handles side effects in functional components. Both are used the same way in React and React Native.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How do I navigate between screens in React Native?</span>
      <div class="answer">Use a navigation library like React Navigation to set up screen transitions. It provides functions to navigate, go back, and pass data between screens.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How do I create and use JavaScript variables and constants?</span>
      <div class="answer">Use <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> to declare variables. <code>const</code> is for values that won’t change, and <code>let</code> allows reassignment.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How do I create functions in JavaScript, and what are the differences between function expressions and declarations?</span>
      <div class="answer">Functions can be declared using function expressions or declarations. Expressions are stored in variables, while declarations are hoisted.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How can I add and style components in React Native?</span>
      <div class="answer">Use JavaScript-based styling with the <code>StyleSheet</code> API or inline styles to add styling to components in React Native.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">What are JavaScript arrays, and how can I loop through them?</span>

    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">What is the difference between <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> in JavaScript?</span>
      <div class="answer"><code>var</code> is function-scoped, while <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped. <code>const</code> is used for constants that don’t change.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="question">How do I display a list of items in React Native with <code>FlatList</code>?</span>
